

_builtin_popcount(x): This function is used to count the number of one’s(set bits) in an integer.
Example:
if x = 4
binary value of 4 is 100
Output: No of ones is 1.

Count of 1s in binary of 5 is 2
Note: Similarly you can use __builtin_popcountl(x) & __builtin_popcountll(x) for long and long long data types.





_builtin_parity(x): This function is used to check the parity of a number. This function returns true(1) if the number has odd parity else it returns false(0) for even parity.
Example:
if x = 7
7 has odd no. of 1's in its binary(111).
Output: Parity of 7 is 1 


Output:
Parity of 7 is 1
Note: Similarly you can use __builtin_parityl(x) & __builtin_parityll(x) for long and long long data types.





__builtin_clz(x): This function is used to count the leading zeros of the integer. Note : clz = count leading zero’s
Example: It counts number of zeros before the first occurrence of one(set bit).
a = 16
Binary form of 16 is 00000000 00000000 00000000 00010000
Output: 27

Note: __builtin_clz(x) This function only accept unsigned values
Note: Similarly you can use __builtin_clzl(x) & __builtin_clzll(x) for long and long long data types.
